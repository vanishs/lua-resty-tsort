# lua-resty-tsort

Performs a topological sort on input data.

## Synopsis

```lua
return require("umd").define({
    "exports",
    "github.com/vanishs/lua-resty-tsort-release001/lib/resty/tsort"
}, function(exports, tsort)

  function exports.init()
    local graph = tsort.new()

    graph:add('a', 'b')
    graph:add('b', 'c')
    graph:add('0', 'a')

    graph:sort()

    -- Output:
    -- {
    --   "0",
    --   "a",
    --   "b",
    --   "c"
    -- }

    graph:add('1', '2', '3', 'a');

    graph:sort()

    -- Output:
    -- {
    --   "0",
    --   "1",
    --   "2",
    --   "3",
    --   "a",
    --   "b",
    --   "c"
    -- }

    graph:add{'1', '1.5'};
    graph:add{'1.5', 'a'};

    graph:sort()

    -- Output:
    -- {
    --   "0",
    --   "1",
    --   "2",
    --   "3",
    --   "1.5",
    --   "a",
    --   "b",
    --   "c"
    -- }

    graph:add('first', 'second');
    graph:add('second', 'third', 'first');

    local sorted, err = graph:sort()

    -- Returns:
    -- sorted = nil
    -- err = "There is a circular dependency in the graph. It is not possible to derive a topological sort."

  end
end)

```

## Alternatives

Before developing this library, I asked on #lua channel on Freenode if anyone knows a library that does
topological sort. I also tried to search for a library. Unfortunately I didn't find anything. But, there
was already a library from the great [@starius](https://github.com/starius) called [toposort](https://github.com/starius/toposort/).
`toposort` looks really nice and it has a lot more features compared to `lua-resty-tsort` (also code, 245 lines vs. 58 lines).
So you may want to take a look to that as well especially if you are looking for a more full featured library.
I have not benchmarked these libs or compared them to C-implementation of tsort or other alternatives. If your graph
is not too big, say you use these to sort Javascript / CSS files or something similar, I think the performance
is not an issue.
